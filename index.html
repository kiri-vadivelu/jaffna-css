      <h1>Jaffna Classless CSS</h1>
      <h3>What is Jaffna CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        Jaffna CSS is a classless CSS framework. The framework expands on the
        great movement of classless revolution to make tech more advanced and
        accessible to everyone. Jaffna CSS was created out of necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is significant gap between classless CSS such as
        <a href="https://simplecss.org/">SimpleCSS</a> and full of class CSS
        such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or
        sophisticated <a href="https://get.foundation/">Foundation</a>, while
        excluding famous <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>
        appetite without discussion. Jaffna CSS elegantly fills the space with
        some classes needed to design the complete static website.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the meaning of the name Jaffna?</h3>
      <p>
        The name Jaffna refers to the capital city of Eelam Tamil people in Sri
        Lanka. Jaffna was the most advanced international trading hub thousands
        of years ago in prior to back to back colonization of the former British
        colony Ceylon.
      </p>

      <h3>Is there any historical significance of Tamils?</h3>

      <p>
        As one of the most advanced civilization in Asia, Tamil people are
        indigenous people of the South India. Even after repeat colonial
        exploitation and genocidal war that consumed millions of innocent lives,
        resilient Tamil people continue to live and rebuild Jaffna.
      </p>

      <h3>How does the history of Tamil help others?</h3>
      <p>
        Gracefully, the social, economical and scientific advancement of ancient
        Tamil people continue benefit global community in many ways. Tamil
        people truly embrace justice, equality and spiritual sharing of
        universal space in harmony with nature for the benefit of humanity.
